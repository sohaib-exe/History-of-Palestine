          <h2>The Timeline of A Genocide:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1940-44</strong> - During World War II, increased Jewish immigration to Palestine led to heightened tensions. The Holocaust in Europe accelerated the Zionist movement, as Jewish refugees sought a safe haven. British policies attempted to limit Jewish immigration, causing friction and sparking the rise of Jewish militant groups.</li>
            <li><strong>1945-49</strong> - Post-WWII saw a significant influx of Holocaust survivors to Palestine. In 1947, the UN proposed partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, leading to civil war. Israel declared independence in 1948, followed by the first Arab-Israeli War. By 1949, armistice agreements were signed, marking new territorial boundaries.</li>
            <li><strong>1950-54</strong> - Israel focused on state-building and absorbing immigrants, passing the Law of Return in 1950. Tensions with neighboring Arab states escalated, with frequent border skirmishes and political strife. Israel's security strategies and regional geopolitics remained fraught with challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>1955-59</strong> - The period was marked by the Suez Crisis in 1956, where Israel, Britain, and France attacked Egypt, leading to Israel's brief occupation of the Sinai Peninsula. This period saw increased militarization in the region and the strengthening of Arab nationalist sentiments, especially under Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser.</li>
            <li><strong>1960-64</strong> - This era witnessed growing national identity among Palestinians and increasing fedayeen attacks from Gaza and Jordan. The establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964 marked a significant step towards a unified Palestinian national movement.</li>
            <li><strong>1965-69</strong> - The mid-1960s saw escalating tensions leading to the Six-Day War in 1967, where Israel significantly expanded its territory. This war had profound implications, including the displacement of Palestinians and the beginning of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.</li>
            <li><strong>1970-74</strong> - The Black September conflict in 1970 resulted in Jordan expelling Palestinian groups. The Munich Olympics massacre in 1972 and the subsequent Israeli retaliation highlighted the international dimension of the conflict. The Yom Kippur War in 1973 saw a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria against Israel.</li>
            <li><strong>1975-79</strong> - This period was marked by the 1978 Camp David Accords, a significant step towards peace between Egypt and Israel. The accords led to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty, with Israel returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, the first recognition of Israel by an Arab country.</li>
            <li><strong>1980-84</strong> - Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem in 1980 and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to combat PLO forces were key events. The Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982 during the Lebanon invasion drew international condemnation.</li>
            <li><strong>1985-89</strong> - Israel's conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon continued, and the First Intifada, a Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, began in 1987. The uprising marked a significant shift in the nature of the conflict, bringing it to international attention.</li>
            <li><strong>1990-94</strong> - The Gulf War in 1990-1991 impacted regional dynamics. The Madrid Conference in 1991 and the Oslo Accords in 1993 initiated a peace process, leading to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and a framework for resolving the conflict.</li>
            <li><strong>1995-99</strong> - The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 was a major setback to the peace process. However, efforts continued with the Israel-Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in 1998, which attempted to further Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.</li>
            <li><strong>2000-2004</strong> - The Second Intifada broke out in 2000 following the failure of the Camp David Summit. This period was marked by significant violence and military operations, such as Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, severely straining Israeli-Palestinian relations.</li>
            <li><strong>2005-2009</strong> - Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005 was a major event, followed by Hamas's electoral victory in 2006 and the subsequent Israel-Hezbollah War. Tensions remained high, with continued conflict in Gaza.</li>
            <li><strong>2010-2014</strong> - The period saw several critical events, including the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, the 2011 Palestinian statehood bid at the UN, and the 2014 Gaza War (Operation Protective Edge). These events reflected the deepening divide and the complexity of achieving a lasting peace.</li>
            <li><strong>2015-2019</strong> - This period was characterized by sporadic violence and stalled peace efforts. U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017 and subsequent embassy move heightened tensions. The Trump administration's peace plan faced criticism and skepticism.</li>
            <li><strong>2020-2023</strong> - The Abraham Accords in 2020 marked a significant shift, with several Arab nations normalizing relations with Israel. However, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict persisted with tensions and violence, notably in Gaza in 2021. The conflict remained unresolved with intermittent flare-ups and no significant progress towards a comprehensive peace agreement.</li>
